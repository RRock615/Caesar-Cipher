# Cryptanalysis of Caesar Cipher

This program provides the results of a statistical analysis that calculates how likely a given value, i, will be useful in converting a encrypted string of charachters into an English message following the principles of the Caesar Cipher. 

# Info
This program utalizes a table of character frequencies for every letter of the English alphabet. Different tables have different frequencies. As such, answers will vary depending on the frequencies used. 

# Algorithm
phi(x) = sigma(0<=c<=25)f(c)p(c-i)
φ(i)=∑_(i=0)^25▒〖f(c)p(c-i)〗
